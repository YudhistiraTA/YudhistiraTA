Fullstack guy. Mostly JS/TS and Go, but started with C by reading the [Holy Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

You might not see much public repo here because I have mediocre discipline and tend to abandon personal projects 2 weeks after starting.

### ðŸ’» Work

Currently handling a Go backend while undergoing a Computer Science bachelor program. 

### ðŸ“š Literature

Reading [Understanding the Linux Kernel](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs380p/papers/ulk3.pdf) and [Modern Operating System](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf). Also Simone de Beauvoir's [The Second Sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Sex)

### ðŸ§  Study

Trying to implement some compute shader using [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) for some university courses.

### ðŸŽ® Waste of Time

Horses. Also, Death Stranding.
