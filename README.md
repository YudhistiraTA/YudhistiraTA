Fullstack guy. Mostly JS/TS, but started with C by reading the [Holy Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

You might not see much public repo here because I have mediocre discipline and tend to abandon personal projects 2 weeks after starting.

### ðŸ’» Work

Currently also handling mobile development using Flutter with a Go backend. 

Also currently undergoing a Computer Science bachelor program. 

### ðŸ“š Literature

Currently chewing through SICP and Satre's Being and Nothingness. I have no idea what's going on with either of these.

### ðŸ§  Study

Currently studying linux operating system and QT with C++. My goal is to actually break away from web development and move to desktop development, or something lower level. The internet sucks.
